# JasonLinPortfolio

Welcome to my 3D interactive portfolio! My name is Jason Lin and I am a soon to be graduate from the University of California, San Diego recieving my Bachelors in Computer Science. I have always loved games whether it be playing them or more recently creating them with OpenGL or Unity! I decided to create a way to browse through some of my information and experiences that is similar to a game to give people some fun playing around with it! 

The portfolio showcases building graphics with the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) framework which uses WebGL to create dynamic 3D graphic applications for browsers.
